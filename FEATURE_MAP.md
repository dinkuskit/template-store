# Feature ownership map

This map is the repository contract for bounded template work. Features own
their implementation, tests, and public entry. Cross-feature access goes
through an `index.ts` entry.

| Stable feature ID | Responsibility | Owned paths | Public entry | Dependencies | Quick proof | Full proof | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dinkus.store-shell` | Neutral Astro/EmDash shell, CMS composition, document metadata, and shared page frame | `src/features/store-shell/`; `src/pages/index.astro`; `src/live.config.ts`; `seed/` | `src/features/store-shell/index.ts` | EmDash; `@dinkuskit/blocks`; managed-product and unmanaged-product public entries | `bin/verify-web quick` | `bin/verify-web full` | verified pilot |
| `dinkus.managed-product-availability` | Commerce catalog identity, official Configure Inventory orchestration, Inventory registration/opening/read/adjust composition, proof adapter, proof-only HTTP action, and storefront availability panel | `src/features/managed-product-availability/`; `src/pages/api/proof/stock.ts` | `src/features/managed-product-availability/index.ts` | `@dinkuskit/commerce` package root; `@dinkuskit/inventory` package root | `bin/verify-web quick` | `bin/verify-web full` | verified pilot |
| `dinkus.unmanaged-product-sellability` | Unmanaged Commerce catalog identity, isolated manual availability, unified storefront resolver, proof-only HTTP action, and storefront sellability panel that never contacts Inventory or shows quantity | `src/features/unmanaged-product-sellability/`; `src/pages/api/proof/unmanaged-availability.ts` | `src/features/unmanaged-product-sellability/index.ts` | `@dinkuskit/commerce` package root | `bin/verify-web quick` | `bin/verify-web full` | verified pilot |

## Storefront drivers

| Journey | How to reach | Proof action | Observable success |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Managed Inventory `8 → 5 → 8` | Open `/` after EmDash setup. Public panel `#managed-product` / `[data-managed-product]`. Admin composition remains the Pages `home` entry at `/_emdash/admin/content/pages/home`. | POST `/api/proof/stock` with `{ commandId, delta: "-3", reason: "proof-change" }`, reload, then POST `{ commandId, delta: "3", reason: "proof-restore" }` and reload. Proof mode only (`DINKUS_PROOF_MODE=1`). | `[data-commerce-sku]` is `DINKUS-DEMO-001`. `[data-inventory-sku]` is `dinkus-inventory-sku-demo`. `[data-stock-value]` reads `8`, then `5`, then `8`. `[data-stock-version]` increases monotonically. Hero action contrast stays readable and neither the page nor the fact rail overflows. |
| Unmanaged manual availability | Open `/` after EmDash setup. Public panel `#unmanaged-product` / `[data-unmanaged-product]`. A human reaches the same product from admin by editing the page-hero secondary CTA on Pages `home` without a code change. Manual status itself is Commerce-owned (`catalog-items/set-manual-availability`); the playground POST is the local stand-in until Commerce ships visual admin UI. | POST `/api/proof/unmanaged-availability` with `{ catalogItemId: "dinkus-template-unmanaged-product", status }` cycling `out-of-stock` → `available-on-backorder` → `in-stock`. Proof mode only. | `[data-unmanaged-sku]` is `DINKUS-DEMO-UNMANAGED`. Default `[data-availability-status]=in-stock` and `[data-sellable]=true` with `[data-quantity-shown]=never` and no `[data-stock-value]` inside the panel. Status then becomes `out-of-stock` / not sellable, `available-on-backorder` / sellable, then `in-stock` / sellable. Quantity remains absent. Admin before/after screenshots of Pages `home` stay operable. |

## Boundary rules

- No template file imports a Dinkus package feature internal. Pre-release
  aliases terminate at package-root `src/index.ts` only.
- CMS content and transactional facts remain separate authorities even when one
  storefront page presents both.
- The proof adapter stays inside `managed-product-availability` and is never
  presented as a production adapter.
- The unmanaged proof adapter stays inside `unmanaged-product-sellability`. It
  never contacts Inventory, never copies a quantity onto the storefront, and is
  never presented as a production adapter.
- The product bootstrap enters Inventory through Commerce's store configuration
  and `configureCatalogItemInventory`; the browser-facing command supplies only
  the Commerce catalog item identity.
- Unmanaged storefront reads go through `resolveStorefrontAvailability`. Manual
  availability writes go through `setCatalogItemManualAvailability`.
- Named order reservations and stock transfers exist on the Inventory pin.
  This playground does not consume them.
- Cart, checkout, payments, shipping, deployment, persisted Manage Stock
  toggle, and package publication are outside this map.
